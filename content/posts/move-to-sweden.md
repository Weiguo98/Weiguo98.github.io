Before landed in Sweden:
1. passport and work permit
   check the work permit progress.
        immigration agency, you can also get more information about what kind of documenation is needed, and read some requirements of it.
2. pack the luggage
   There are some normal stufff that for travelling, I think there is no need to repeat. But here are something like I think it is important to bring if you are first come to Sweden.
   - raincoat/防水外套: There is always some rain during winter, autumn and spring. And since Gothenburg is near the sea, it is also super windy. As a result, most of the time, it is not a good idea to use the umbrella. I would recommand to bring the anti-water coat, it would be much easier and almost every swedes have one.
   - some hometown kitchenware and food: Sweden food is not very fancy and interesting. If you are from a country full of deleicious food, I recommend you to bring some special pot/species that can used for cooking. For sure, you gonna miss that.
   - Adpater. If you are not from Euorpe, makee sure to bring appropriate adapters. But if you forget, it is fine you can always buy it from clas oshon.
